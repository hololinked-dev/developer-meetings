# hololinked v1.0.0 roadmap

### Background

Currently we are running v0.2 for more than 6 months. Its a basic proof of concept, stable mostly under HTTP protocol and JSON serializations. Other ZMQ protocols and serializations also work, stably, given that each protocol is bound to a serialization format. This is very useful, but not technically sound. Moreover, since we already know that the implementations are independent of protocol or serilization (i.e. we have both HTTP and ZMQ (TCP, IPC) working), its stupid to not support other protocols and serializations. 

### Goal

The v1.0 version will implement the Web of Things concept of protocol bindings and content type specified under the forms field. To achieve this:
- forms will be generated by the protocol server
- serialization will be bound to content types as muich as possible
- per property, per action and per event serialization format ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/27))
- the concept of ZMQServer, EventLoop, and Thing will be sorted out ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/28))

Apart from this, we will also implement the following:
- CoAP protocol binding
- RPC server will respect execution timeout ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/13))
- TD generation using interaction affordance objects directly ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/14))
- using pydantic for validation of action and property payloads ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/15))
- improvement of logging and possible integration with a logging software stack ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/51))
- asyncio create task and threaded actions supported more natively ([Issue](https://github.com/hololinked-dev/hololinked/issues/58))

This will be first released as v0.3.0, potentially solving some more issues while things get stabilised. The aimed code coverage is 75%.

### Target

The target for the v1.0 release is 31.12.2025. The target for the v0.3 release is 31.08.2025.
